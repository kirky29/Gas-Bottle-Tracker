A simple, mobile-first web application to track your gas bottle spending and usage.

## How It Works

The app tracks your gas bottle connections by:

1. **Recording Connections**: Add the date and cost when you connect a new gas bottle
2. **Calculating Usage**: Uses the bottle weight (default 47KG) to calculate total gas usage
3. **Tracking Costs**: Monitors total spending and average costs per bottle
4. **Flexible Settings**: Update bottle weight and price as they change over time

## Default Settings

- **Bottle Price**: Â£83.50

You can update these settings at any time to reflect current prices and bottle sizes.
